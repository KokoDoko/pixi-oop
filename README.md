# Object Oriented PIXI in Javascript

This is an experiment to build an OOP game in PIXIJS using Javascript classes and native ES6 modules, *without* using a build process. PixiJS is loaded with a `<script>` tag. There is no publish folder or compilation process ðŸ¤¯. Just open `index.html` via a live server or localhost!

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Extending Pixi Classes

You can extend ***pixi graphics, sprites, tilingsprites, text***, etc. This makes the code very readable. This example shows a player sprite that has a `speed` and an `update` method:

```javascript
export class Player extends PIXI.Sprite {

    #speed

    constructor(texture) {
        super(texture)
        this.#speed = 10
    }

    update(){
        this.x += this.#speed
    }
}
```
In your main game, you can now add a `Player` to your game:
```javascript

import { Player } from "./player.js"

export class Game {

    player

    constructor(){
        ...
    }

    doneLoading() {
        this.player = new Player(texture)
        this.pixi.stage.addChild(this.player)
        this.player.update()
    }
}
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

## ES6 Classes

Classes in ES6 are a very similar to classes in typescript or C#, but:

- New properties can be added *anywhere* in the class. 
- Properties and methods can be made `private` by adding a `#` before the name of the variable or method. This only works when targeting the latest ES version in `jsconfig.json`.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Type checking

By setting `checkJS` to true in `jsconfig.json`, we get intellisense and type checking in javascript.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ Native module and type checking for PIXI

Ideally, we should import PixiJS as a native module too. [There is a native module for Pixi 5](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/issues/6734) but not for 6?

Else we should include type definitions for Pixi6 as a `.d.ts` file. This is included in `node_modules` after running `npm install pixi-js`, but does not seem to be available separately.
