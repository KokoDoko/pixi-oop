# Object Oriented PIXI in Javascript

This is an experiment to build an OOP game in PIXIJS using Javascript classes and native ES6 modules. There is no publish folder or compilation process ðŸ¤¯. Just open `index.html` via a live server or localhost!

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Extending Pixi Classes

You can extend ***pixi graphics, sprites, tilingsprites, text***, etc. This makes the code very readable. This example shows a player sprite that has a `speed` and an `update` method:

```javascript
import { Sprite } from './mygame/pixi.mjs'

export class Player extends Sprite {

    #speed

    constructor(texture) {
        super(texture)
        this.#speed = 10
    }

    update(){
        this.x += this.#speed
    }
}
```
In your main game, you can now add a `Player` to your game:
```javascript

import { Player } from "./player.js"

export class Game {

    player

    constructor(){
        ...
    }

    doneLoading() {
        this.player = new Player(texture)
        this.pixi.stage.addChild(this.player)
        this.player.update()
    }
}
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

## ES6 Classes

Classes in ES6 are a very similar to classes in typescript or C#, but:

- New properties can be added *anywhere* in the class. 
- Properties and methods can be made `private` by adding a `#` before the name of the variable or method. This only works when targeting the latest ES version in `jsconfig.json`.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Type checking

By setting `checkJS` to true in `jsconfig.json`, we get intellisense and type checking in javascript.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Native PIXI module

ðŸ”¥ This project loads PIXIJS as a module from `./js/libraries/pixi.mjs`!

You can find this module if you run `npm install pixi-js` and then open the `node_modules` folder. This contains the native pixi module in `node_modules/pixi.js/dist/esm/pixi.js`. 

The type definitions are in `node_modules/pixi.js/index.d.ts`. You can copy these files and then discard the `node_modules` folder. In your project you can then use:

```typescript
import { Application, Sprite, Loader } from './mygame/pixi.mjs'
```

### ðŸ’€ TODO

The `index.d.ts` type definitions seem not to be recognised, or are not up to date, because some pixi functions will not get auto completed in VS Code. They WILL work though.
